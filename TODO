THINGS TODO
-----------
* Make "unload" be more sensible, as to what is the opposite behavior
  of "use", "unuse", "load", & "unload" in unloading a module.

* Add a "init*" tests to testsuite

* Add a "swap" test to testsuite

* Use the "module avail" cache even for the module load/unload lookups

* Add --remove (opposite of --create) to remove cache files

* Add exec keyword to execute "embedded" Tcl routines in module files

* Use "configure" to set more default values, and to configure
	the global rc files specifically for the platform.

* add --enable-dot-ext option to configure & files to handle the
	case where the dot files are symbolic links to system
	controlled dot files and the user extensions are done
	through .`startup'.ext files.

* Add RPM distribution creation to Makefile.
