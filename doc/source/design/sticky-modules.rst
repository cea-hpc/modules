Sticky modules
==============

Configuration
-------------

- No specific configuration

Specification
-------------

- Once loaded a sticky module cannot be unloaded unless

  - forced
  - or reloaded
  - or when restoring a collection
  - or resetting to initial environment state

- If module is super-sticky instead of sticky, it cannot be unloaded even if forced, only if it is reloaded afterward

- Stickiness definition relies on :ref:`module-tags`

  - ``module-tag sticky foo/1.0`` defines module *foo/1.0* as sticky
  - ``module-tag super-sticky foo/1.0`` defines module *foo/1.0* as super-sticky

- Stickiness specified over a symbolic version or a module alias has no effect

  - ``module-tag`` allows to specify a symbolic module version or a module alias
  - but associated tag will apply to the symbolic version or alias only
  - as modulefile targeted by symbol or alias does not inherit their tags
  - so a sticky or super-sticky tag set on a symbolic version or alias has no effect

- Sticky module can be swapped with another version from same module when stickiness is defined over module parent name

  - For instance if stickiness is defined over module *foo*, *foo/1.0* can be swapped with *foo/2.0*
  - Such swap could occur from a ``restore`` or a ``switch`` sub-command
  - As soon as stickiness is defined over a precise module version name (like *foo/1.0*) such module cannot be swapped by another version of *foo* module
  - Stickiness defined over module parent name (like *foo*) means *any version from module foo must be loaded*
  - When stickiness is defined for several module versions using advanced version specifiers like *foo@1:* or *foo@1.0,2.0*

    - it means stickiness applies to the module versions
    - thus they cannot be swapped by another version

  - In case stickiness is defined over module parent name and another ``module-tag`` defines stickiness over specific module version name

    - it means stickiness applies to the module version
    - thus these versions targeted specifically with ``module-tag`` cannot be swapped by another version from same module

- When a super-sticky module depends on a non-super-sticky module

  - If a forced ``purge`` command occurs, the dependent module will be unloaded
  - Which let the super-sticky module with a missing dependency

- Starting Modules 5.2, sticky modules are unloaded

  - On :subcmd:`restore` sub-command
  - On :subcmd:`reset` sub-command if :mconfig:`reset_target_state` is not equal to ``__purge__``
  - No specific error or warning message
  - This is allowed to fully restore the collection in its targeted state
  - No change for super-sticky modules

- An error is reported when trying to unload a sticky or super-sticky module

  - As the expected unload is not performed
  - So with the return code and message, user knows that what he/she asked for was not done
  - Same goes for the ``purge`` command: user expects no more module loaded

    - so an error is returned as after the command the sticky module is still loaded

  - When the unload is forced a warning message is reported

    - the sticky module is unloaded as expected but a warning message is done
    - as the module was tagged not to be unloaded by default
    - user should know he/she has done something specific

- Reporting an error during a ``purge`` may be considered inappropriate

  - as purge cannot unload the sticky, so it may be considered normal not to
    be able to unload the loaded sticky or super-sticky modules
  - a configuration option :mconfig:`sticky_purge` is introduced on Modules
    5.4 to define behavior when facing sticky/super-sticky modules during a
    ``purge``:

    - when set to ``error`` (default), and error is raised
    - when set to ``warning``, a warning message is reported, no error exit
      code
    - when set to ``silent``, no message reported, no error exit code

  - Even when ``sticky_purge`` is set to ``silent``, a warning message is
    reported when unload of sticky module is forced during a purge.


Current limitations
-------------------

- When swapping a sticky module explicitly targeted by the ``module-tag`` command and which is the default version

  - For instance ``module-tag sticky foo/1.0`` and ``module-version foo/1.0 default``
  - If specified swapped-on module is the generic module name, for instance *foo*
  - ``switch`` sub-command raises an error even if the sticky module is the default version (either implicit or explicitly set) for this module
