SYNOPSIS
--------

**module** [*switches*] [*sub-command* [*sub-command-args*]]


DESCRIPTION
-----------

**module** is a user interface to the Modules package. The Modules
package provides for the dynamic modification of the user's environment
via *modulefiles*.

Each *modulefile* contains the information needed to configure the
shell for an application. Once the Modules package is initialized, the
environment can be modified on a per-module basis using the **module**
command which interprets *modulefiles*. Typically *modulefiles* instruct
the **module** command to alter or set shell environment variables such
as **PATH**, **MANPATH**, etc. *Modulefiles* may be shared by many users
on a system and users may have their own set to supplement or replace the
shared *modulefiles*.

The *modulefiles* are added to and removed from the current environment
by the user. The environment changes contained in a *modulefile* can be
summarized through the **module** command as well. If no arguments are
given, a summary of the **module** usage and *sub-commands* are shown.

The action for the **module** command to take is described by the
*sub-command* and its associated arguments.


Package Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Modules package and the **module** command are initialized when a
shell-specific initialization script is sourced into the shell. The script
creates the **module** command as either an alias or function and creates
Modules environment variables.

The **module** alias or function executes the **modulecmd.tcl** program
located in |emph libexecdir| and has the shell evaluate the command's
output. The first argument to **modulecmd.tcl** specifies the type of shell.

The initialization scripts are kept in |emph initdir|\ */<shell>* where
*<shell>* is the name of the sourcing shell. For example, a C Shell user
sources the |emph initdir|\ */csh* script. The sh, csh, tcsh, bash, ksh,
zsh and fish shells are supported by **modulecmd.tcl**. In addition,
python, perl, ruby, tcl, cmake, r and lisp "shells" are supported which
writes the environment changes to stdout as python, perl, ruby, tcl, lisp,
r or cmake code.

Initialization may also be performed by calling the **autoinit** sub-command
of the **modulecmd.tcl** program. Evaluation into the shell of the result
of this command defines the **module** alias or function.


Examples of initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

C Shell initialization (and derivatives):

.. parsed-literal::

     source \ |initdir|\ /csh
     module load modulefile modulefile ...

Bourne Shell (sh) (and derivatives):

.. parsed-literal::

     . \ |initdir|\ /sh
     module load modulefile modulefile ...

Perl:

.. parsed-literal::

     require "\ |initdir|\ /perl.pm";
     &module('load', 'modulefile', 'modulefile', '...');

Python:

.. parsed-literal::

     import os
     exec(open('\ |initdir|\ /python.py').read())
     module('load', 'modulefile', 'modulefile', '...')

Bourne Shell (sh) (and derivatives) with **autoinit** sub-command:

.. parsed-literal::

     eval "\`\ |libexecdir|\ /modulecmd.tcl sh autoinit\`"


Modulecmd startup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upon invocation **modulecmd.tcl** sources a site-specific configuration
script if it exists. The location for this script is
|emph etcdir|\ */siteconfig.tcl*. An additional siteconfig script may be
specified with the *$MODULES_SITECONFIG* environment variable and will be
loaded if it exists after |emph etcdir|\ */siteconfig.tcl*. Siteconfig is a
Tcl script that enables to supersede any global variable or procedure
definition of **modulecmd.tcl**.

Afterward, **modulecmd.tcl** sources rc files which contain global,
user and *modulefile* specific setups. These files are interpreted as
*modulefiles*. See :ref:`modulefile(4)` for detailed information.

Upon invocation of **modulecmd.tcl** module run-command files are sourced
in the following order:

1. Global RC file as specified by *$MODULERCFILE* or |emph prefix|\ */etc/rc*.
   If *$MODULERCFILE* points to a directory, the *modulerc* file in this
   directory is used as global RC file.

2. User specific module RC file *$HOME/.modulerc*

3. All *.modulerc* and *.version* files found during modulefile seeking.


Command line switches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **module** command accepts command line switches as its first parameter.
These may be used to control output format of all information displayed and
the **module** behavior in case of locating and interpreting *modulefiles*.

All switches may be entered either in short or long notation. The following
switches are accepted:

**--help**, **-h**

 Give some helpful usage information, and terminates the command.

**--version**, **-V**

 Lists the current version of the **module** command. The command then
 terminates without further processing.

**--debug**, **-D**

 Debug mode. Causes **module** to print debugging messages about its
 progress.

**--paginate**

 Pipe all message output into *less* (or if set, *$MODULES_PAGER*) if error
 output stream is a terminal. See also **MODULES_PAGER** section.

**--no-pager**

 Do not pipe message output into a pager.

**--color**\[=\ *WHEN*\]

 Colorize the output. *WHEN* defaults to *always* or can be *never* or *auto*.
 See also **MODULES_COLOR** section.

**--auto**

 On **load**, **unload** and **switch** sub-commands, enable automated module
 handling mode. See also **MODULES_AUTO_HANDLING** section.

**--no-auto**

 On **load**, **unload** and **switch** sub-commands, disable automated module
 handling mode. See also **MODULES_AUTO_HANDLING** section.

**--force**, **-f**

 On **load**, **unload** and **switch** sub-commands, by-pass any unsatisfied
 modulefile constraint corresponding to the declared **prereq** and
 **conflict**. Which means for instance that a *modulefile* will be loaded
 even if it comes in conflict with another loaded *modulefile* or that a
 *modulefile* will be unloaded even if it is required as a prereq by another
 *modulefile*.

 On **clear** sub-command, skip the confirmation dialog and proceed.

**--terse**, **-t**

 Display **avail**, **list** and **savelist** output in short format.

**--long**, **-l**

 Display **avail**, **list** and **savelist** output in long format.

**--default**, **-d**

 On **avail** sub-command, display only the default version of each module
 name. Default version is either the explicitly set default version or
 the highest numerically sorted *modulefile* if no default version set
 (see Locating Modulefiles section in the :ref:`modulefile(4)` man page).

**--latest**, **-L**

 On **avail** sub-command, display only the highest numerically sorted
 version of each module name (see Locating Modulefiles section in the
 :ref:`modulefile(4)` man page).

**--indepth**

 On **avail** sub-command, include in search results the matching modulefiles
 and directories and recursively the modulefiles and directories contained in
 these matching directories.

**--no-indepth**

 On **avail** sub-command, limit search results to the matching modulefiles
 and directories found at the depth level expressed by the search query. Thus
 modulefiles contained in directories part of the result are excluded.


Module Sub-Commands
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**help** [modulefile...]

 Print the usage of each sub-command. If an argument is given, print the
 Module-specific help information for the *modulefile*.

**add** modulefile...

 See **load**.

**load** [--auto|--no-auto] [-f] modulefile...

 Load *modulefile* into the shell environment.

**rm** modulefile...

 See **unload**.

**unload** [--auto|--no-auto] [-f] modulefile...

 Remove *modulefile* from the shell environment.

**swap** [modulefile1] modulefile2

 See **switch**.

**switch** [--auto|--no-auto] [-f] [modulefile1] modulefile2

 Switch loaded *modulefile1* with *modulefile2*. If *modulefile1* is not
 specified, then it is assumed to be the currently loaded module with the
 same root name as *modulefile2*.

**show** modulefile...

 See **display**.

**display** modulefile...

 Display information about one or more *modulefiles*. The display sub-command
 will list the full path of the *modulefile* and the environment changes
 the *modulefile* will make if loaded. (Note: It will not display any
 environment changes found within conditional statements.)

**list** [-t|-l]

 List loaded modules.

**avail** [-d|-L] [-t|-l] [--indepth|--no-indepth] [path...]

 List all available *modulefiles* in the current **MODULEPATH**. All
 directories in the **MODULEPATH** are recursively searched for files
 containing the *modulefile* magic cookie. If an argument is given, then
 each directory in the **MODULEPATH** is searched for *modulefiles* whose
 pathname, symbolic version-name or alias match the argument. Argument
 may contain wildcard characters. Multiple versions of an application can
 be supported by creating a subdirectory for the application containing
 *modulefiles* for each version.

 Symbolic version-names and aliases found in the search are displayed in the
 result of this sub-command. Symbolic version-names are displayed next to
 the *modulefile* they are assigned to within parenthesis. Aliases are listed
 in the **MODULEPATH** section where they have been defined. To distinguish
 aliases from *modulefiles* a **@** symbol is added within parenthesis
 next to their name. Aliases defined through a global or user specific
 module RC file are listed under the **global/user modulerc** section.

 When colored output is enabled and a specific graphical rendition is defined
 for module *default* version, the **default** symbol is omitted and instead
 the defined graphical rendition is applied to the relative modulefile. When
 colored output is enabled and a specific graphical rendition is defined for
 module alias, the **@** symbol is omitted. The defined graphical rendition
 applies to the module alias name. See **MODULES_COLOR** and
 **MODULES_COLORS** sections for details on colored output.

**aliases**

 List all available symbolic version-names and aliases in the current
 **MODULEPATH**.  All directories in the **MODULEPATH** are recursively
 searched in the same manner than for the **avail** sub-command. Only the
 symbolic version-names and aliases found in the search are displayed.

**use** [-a|--append] directory...

 Prepend one or more *directories* to the **MODULEPATH** environment
 variable.  The *--append* flag will append the *directory* to
 **MODULEPATH**.

 Reference counter environment variable **MODULEPATH_modshare** is
 also set to increase the number of times *directory* has been added to
 **MODULEPATH**.

**unuse** directory...

 Remove one or more *directories* from the **MODULEPATH** environment
 variable if reference counter of these *directories* is equal to 1
 or unknown.

 Reference counter of *directory* in **MODULEPATH** denotes the number of
 times *directory* has been enabled. When attempting to remove *directory*
 from **MODULEPATH**, reference counter variable **MODULEPATH_modshare**
 is checked and *directory* is removed only if its relative counter is
 equal to 1 or not defined. Elsewhere *directory* is kept and reference
 counter is decreased by 1.

**refresh**

 See **reload**.

**reload**

 Unload then load all loaded *modulefiles*.

 No unload then load is performed and an error is returned if the loaded
 *modulefiles* have unsatisfied constraint corresponding to the **prereq**
 and **conflict** they declare.

**purge**

 Unload all loaded *modulefiles*.

**clear** [-f]

 Force the Modules package to believe that no modules are currently loaded. A
 confirmation is requested if command-line switch *-f* (or *--force*) is not
 passed. Typed confirmation should equal to *yes* or *y* in order to proceed.

**source** modulefile...

 Execute *modulefile* into the shell environment. *modulefile* must be
 specified with a fully qualified path. Once executed *modulefile* is not
 marked loaded in shell environment which differ from **load** sub-command.

**whatis** [modulefile...]

 Display the information set up by the **module-whatis** commands inside
 the specified *modulefiles*. These specified *modulefiles* may be
 expressed using wildcard characters. If no *modulefile* is specified,
 all **module-whatis** lines will be shown.

**apropos** string

 See **search**.

**keyword** string

 See **search**.

**search** string

 Seeks through the **module-whatis** informations of all *modulefiles*
 for the specified *string*. All *module-whatis* informations matching
 the *string* will be displayed. *string* may contain wildcard characters.

**test** modulefile...

 Execute and display results of the Module-specific tests for the
 *modulefile*.

**save** [collection]

 Record the currently set **MODULEPATH** directory list and the currently
 loaded *modulefiles* in a *collection* file under the user's collection
 directory *$HOME/.module*. If *collection* name is not specified, then
 it is assumed to be the *default* collection. If *collection* is a fully
 qualified path, it is saved at this location rather than under the user's
 collection directory.

 If **MODULES_COLLECTION_TARGET** is set, a suffix equivalent to the value
 of this variable will be appended to the *collection* file name.

 By default, if loaded modulefile corresponds to the default module version,
 the bare module name is recorded. If **MODULES_COLLECTION_PIN_VERSION** is
 set to **1**, module version is always recorded even if it is the default
 version.

 No *collection* is recorded and an error is returned if the loaded
 *modulefiles* have unsatisfied constraint corresponding to the **prereq**
 and **conflict** they declare.

**restore** [collection]

 Restore the environment state as defined in *collection*. If *collection*
 name is not specified, then it is assumed to be the *default* collection. If
 *collection* is a fully qualified path, it is restored from this location
 rather than from a file under the user's collection directory. If
 **MODULES_COLLECTION_TARGET** is set, a suffix equivalent to the value
 of this variable is appended to the *collection* file name to restore.

 When restoring a *collection*, the currently set **MODULEPATH**
 directory list and the currently loaded *modulefiles* are unused and
 unloaded then used and loaded to exactly match the **MODULEPATH** and
 loaded *modulefiles* lists saved in this *collection* file. The order
 of the paths and modulefiles set in *collection* is preserved when
 restoring. It means that currently loaded modules are unloaded to get
 the same **LOADEDMODULES** root than collection and currently used module
 paths are unused to get the same **MODULEPATH** root. Then missing module
 paths are used and missing modulefiles are loaded.

**saverm** [collection]

 Delete the *collection* file under the user's collection directory. If
 *collection* name is not specified, then it is assumed to be the *default*
 collection. If **MODULES_COLLECTION_TARGET** is set, a suffix equivalent to
 the value of this variable will be appended to the *collection* file name.

**saveshow** [collection]

 Display the content of *collection*. If *collection* name is not specified,
 then it is assumed to be the *default* collection. If *collection* is a
 fully qualified path, this location is displayed rather than a collection
 file under the user's collection directory. If **MODULES_COLLECTION_TARGET**
 is set, a suffix equivalent to the value of this variable will be appended
 to the *collection* file name.

**savelist** [-t|-l]

 List collections that are currently saved under the user's collection
 directory. If **MODULES_COLLECTION_TARGET** is set, only collections
 matching the target suffix will be displayed.

**initadd** modulefile...

 Add *modulefile* to the shell's initialization file in the user's home
 directory. The startup files checked (in order) are:

 C Shell

  *.modules*, *.cshrc*, *.csh_variables* and *.login*

 TENEX C Shell

  *.modules*, *.tcshrc*, *.cshrc*, *.csh_variables* and *.login*

 Friendly Interactive Shell

  *.modules*, *.config/fish/config.fish*

 If a **module load** line is found in any of these files, the *modulefiles*
 are appended to any existing list of *modulefiles*. The **module load**
 line must be located in at least one of the files listed above for any of
 the **init** sub-commands to work properly. If the **module load** line is
 found in multiple shell initialization files, all of the lines are changed.

**initprepend** modulefile...

 Does the same as **initadd** but prepends the given modules to the
 beginning of the list.

**initrm** modulefile...

 Remove *modulefile* from the shell's initialization files.

**initswitch** modulefile1 modulefile2

 Switch *modulefile1* with *modulefile2* in the shell's initialization files.

**initlist**

 List all of the *modulefiles* loaded from the shell's initialization file.

**initclear**

 Clear all of the *modulefiles* from the shell's initialization files.

**path** modulefile

 Print path to *modulefile*.

**paths** modulefile

 Print path of available *modulefiles* matching argument.

**append-path** [-d C|--delim C|--delim=C] [--duplicates] variable value...

 Append *value* to environment *variable*. The *variable* is a colon, or
 *delimiter*, separated list. See **append-path** in the :ref:`modulefile(4)`
 man page for further explanation.

**prepend-path** [-d C|--delim C|--delim=C] [--duplicates] variable value...

 Prepend *value* to environment *variable*. The *variable* is a colon, or
 *delimiter*, separated list. See **prepend-path** in the :ref:`modulefile(4)`
 man page for further explanation.

**remove-path** [-d C|--delim C|--delim=C] [--index] variable value...

 Remove *value* from the colon, or *delimiter*, separated list in environment
 *variable*. See **remove-path** in the :ref:`modulefile(4)` man page for
 further explanation.

**is-loaded** [modulefile...]

 Returns a true value if any of the listed *modulefiles* has been loaded or if
 any *modulefile* is loaded in case no argument is provided. Returns a false
 value elsewhere. See **is-loaded** in the :ref:`modulefile(4)` man page for
 further explanation.

**is-saved** [collection...]

 Returns a true value if any of the listed *collections* exists or if any
 *collection* exists in case no argument is provided. Returns a false value
 elsewhere. See **is-saved** in the :ref:`modulefile(4)` man page for further
 explanation.

**is-used** [directory...]

 Returns a true value if any of the listed *directories* has been enabled in
 **MODULEPATH** or if any *directory* is enabled in case no argument is

 **MODULEPATH**. Returns a false value elsewhere. See **is-avail** in the
 :ref:`modulefile(4)` man page for further explanation.

**info-loaded** modulefile

 Returns the names of currently loaded modules matching passed *modulefile*.
 Returns an empty string if passed *modulefile* does not match any loaded
 modules. See **module-info loaded** in the :ref:`modulefile(4)` man page for
 further explanation.


Modulefiles
^^^^^^^^^^^

*modulefiles* are written in the Tool Command Language (Tcl) and are
interpreted by **modulecmd.tcl**. *modulefiles* can use conditional
statements. Thus the effect a *modulefile* will have on the environment
may change depending upon the current state of the environment.

Environment variables are unset when unloading a *modulefile*. Thus, it is
possible to **load** a *modulefile* and then **unload** it without having
the environment variables return to their prior state.


Collections
^^^^^^^^^^^

Collections describe a sequence of **module use** then **module load**
commands that are interpreted by **modulecmd.tcl** to set the user
environment as described by this sequence. When a collection is activated,
with the **restore** sub-command, module paths and loaded modules are
unused or unloaded if they are not part or if they are not ordered the
same way as in the collection.

Collections are generated by the **save** sub-command that dumps the current
user environment state in terms of module paths and loaded modules. By
default collections are saved under the *$HOME/.module* directory.

Collections may be valid for a given target if they are suffixed. In this
case these collections can only be restored if their suffix correspond to
the current value of the **MODULES_COLLECTION_TARGET** environment variable
(see the dedicated section of this topic below).


EXIT STATUS
-----------

The **module** command exits with **0** if its execution succeed. Elsewhere
**1** is returned.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------

**LOADEDMODULES**

 A colon separated list of all loaded *modulefiles*.

**MODULEPATH**

 The path that the **module** command searches when looking for
 *modulefiles*. Typically, it is set to the master *modulefiles* directory,
 |emph prefix|\ */modulefiles*, by the initialization script. **MODULEPATH**
 can be set using **module use** or by the module initialization script
 to search group or personal *modulefile* directories before or after the
 master *modulefile* directory.

 Path elements registered in the **MODULEPATH** environment variable may
 contain reference to environment variables which are converted to their
 corresponding value by **module** command each time it looks at the
 **MODULEPATH** value. If an environment variable referred in a path element
 is not defined, its reference is converted to an empty string.

**MODULESHOME**

 The location of the master Modules package file directory containing module
 command initialization scripts, the executable program **modulecmd.tcl**,
 and a directory containing a collection of master *modulefiles*.

**MODULES_AUTO_HANDLING**

 If set to **1**, enable automated module handling mode. If set to **0**
 disable automated module handling mode. Other values are ignored.

 Automated module handling mode consists in additional actions triggered when
 loading or unloading a *modulefile* to satisfy the constraints it declares.
 When loading a *modulefile*, following actions are triggered:

 * Requirement Load: load of the *modulefiles* declared as a **prereq** of
   the loading *modulefile*.

 * Dependent Reload: reload of the modulefiles declaring a **prereq** onto
   loaded *modulefile* or declaring a **prereq** onto a *modulefile* part of
   this reloading batch.

 When unloading a *modulefile*, following actions are triggered:

 * Dependent Unload: unload of the modulefiles declaring a non-optional
   **prereq** onto unloaded modulefile or declaring a non-optional **prereq**
   onto a modulefile part of this unloading batch. A **prereq** modulefile is
   considered optional if the **prereq** definition order is made of multiple
   modulefiles and at least one alternative modulefile is loaded.

 * Useless Requirement Unload: unload of the **prereq** modulefiles that have
   been automatically loaded for either the unloaded modulefile, an unloaded
   dependent modulefile or a modulefile part of this useless requirement
   unloading batch. Modulefiles are added to this unloading batch only if
   they are not required by any other loaded modulefiles.

 * Dependent Reload: reload of the modulefiles declaring a **conflict** or an
   optional **prereq** onto either the unloaded modulefile, an unloaded
   dependent or an unloaded useless requirement or declaring a **prereq** onto
   a modulefile part of this reloading batch.

 In case a loaded *modulefile* has some of its declared constraints
 unsatisfied (pre-required modulefile not loaded or conflicting modulefile
 loaded for instance), this loaded *modulefile* is excluded from the automatic
 reload actions described above.

 For the specific case of the **switch** sub-command, where a modulefile is
 unloaded to then load another modulefile. Dependent modulefiles to Unload are
 merged into the Dependent modulefiles to Reload that are reloaded after the
 load of the switched-to modulefile.

 Automated module handling mode enablement is defined in the following order
 of preference: **--auto**/**--no-auto** command line switches,
 then **MODULES_AUTO_HANDLING** environment variable, then the default set in
 **modulecmd.tcl** script configuration. Which means **MODULES_AUTO_HANDLING**
 overrides default configuration and **--auto**/**--no-auto** command line
 switches override every other ways to enable or disable this mode.

**MODULES_AVAIL_INDEPTH**

 If set to **1**, enable in depth search results for **avail** sub-command. If
 set to **0** disable **avail** sub-command in depth mode. Other values are
 ignored.

 When in depth mode is enabled, modulefiles and directories contained in
 directories matching search query are also included in search results. When
 disabled these modulefiles and directories contained in matching directories
 are excluded.

 **avail** sub-command in depth mode enablement is defined in the following
 order of preference: **--indepth**/**--no-indepth** command line switches,
 then **MODULES_AVAIL_INDEPTH** environment variable, then the default set in
 **modulecmd.tcl** script configuration. Which means **MODULES_AVAIL_INDEPTH**
 overrides default configuration and **--indepth**/**--no-indepth** command
 line switches override every other ways to enable or disable this mode.

**MODULES_CMD**

 The location of the active module command script.

**MODULES_COLLECTION_PIN_VERSION**

 If set to **1**, register exact version number of modulefiles when saving a
 collection. Elsewhere modulefile version number is omitted if it corresponds
 to the implicit or explicitly set default version.

**MODULES_COLLECTION_TARGET**

 The collection target that determines what collections are valid thus
 reachable on the current system.

 Collection directory may sometimes be shared on multiple machines which may
 use different modules setup. For instance modules users may access with the
 same **HOME** directory multiple systems using different OS versions. When
 it happens a collection made on machine 1 may be erroneous on machine 2.

 When a target is set, only the collections made for that target are
 available to the **restore**, **savelist**, **saveshow** and **saverm**
 sub-commands. Saving collection registers the target footprint by suffixing
 the collection filename with ``.$MODULES_COLLECTION_TARGET``. Collection
 target is not involved when collection is specified as file path on the
 **saveshow**, **restore** and **save** sub-commands.

 For example, the **MODULES_COLLECTION_TARGET** variable may be set with
 results from commands like **lsb_release**, **hostname**, **dnsdomainname**,
 etc.

**MODULES_COLOR**

 Defines if output should be colored or not. Accepted values are *never*,
 *auto* and *always*.

 When color mode is set to *auto*, output is colored only if the standard
 error output channel is attached to a terminal.

 Colored output enablement is defined in the following order of preference:
 **--color** command line switch, then **MODULES_COLOR** environment variable,
 then the default set in **modulecmd.tcl** script configuration. Which means
 **MODULES_COLOR** overrides default configuration and **--color** command
 line switch overrides every other ways to enable or disable this mode.

**MODULES_COLORS**

 Specifies the colors and other attributes used to highlight various parts of
 the output. Its value is a colon-separated list of output items associated to
 a Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) code. It follows the same syntax than
 **LS_COLORS**.

 Output items are designated by keys. Items able to be colorized are:
 highlighted element (*hi*), debug information (*db*), tag separator (*se*);
 Error (*er*), warning (*wa*), module error (*me*) and info (*in*) message
 prefixes; Modulepath (*mp*), directory (*di*), module alias (*al*), module
 symbolic version (*sy*), module *default* version (*de*) and modulefile
 command (*cm*).

 See the Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) section in the documentation of the
 text terminal that is used for permitted values and their meaning as
 character attributes. These substring values are integers in decimal
 representation and can be concatenated with semicolons. Modules takes care of
 assembling the result into a complete SGR sequence (**\33[...m**). Common
 values to concatenate include 1 for bold, 4 for underline, 30 to 37 for
 foreground colors and 90 to 97 for 16-color mode foreground colors. See also
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_(Select_Graphic_Rendition)_parameters
 for a complete SGR code reference.

 No graphical rendition will be applied to an output item that could normaly
 be colored but which is not defined in the color set. Thus if
 **MODULES_COLORS** is defined empty, no output will be colored at all.

 The color set is defined for Modules in the following order of preference:
 **MODULES_COLORS** environment variable, then the default set in
 **modulecmd.tcl** script configuration. Which means **MODULES_COLORS**
 overrides default configuration.

**MODULES_LMALTNAME**

 A colon separated list of the alternative names set through
 **module-version** and **module-alias** statements corresponding to all
 loaded *modulefiles*. Each element in this list starts by the name of the
 loaded *modulefile* followed by all alternative names resolving to it. The
 loaded modulefile and its alternative names are separated by the ampersand
 character.

 This environment variable is intended for **module** command internal use to
 get knowledge of the alternative names matching loaded *modulefiles* in order
 to keep environment consistent when conflicts or pre-requirements are set
 over these alternative designations. It also helps to find a match after
 *modulefiles* being loaded when **unload**, **is-loaded** or **info-loaded**
 actions are run over these names.

**MODULES_LMCONFLICT**

 A colon separated list of the **conflict** statements defined by all loaded
 *modulefiles*. Each element in this list starts by the name of the loaded
 *modulefile* declaring the conflict followed by the name of all modulefiles
 it declares a conflict with. These loaded modulefiles and conflicting
 modulefile names are separated by the ampersand character.

 This environment variable is intended for **module** command internal
 use to get knowledge of the conflicts declared by the loaded *modulefiles*
 in order to keep environment consistent when a conflicting module is asked
 for load afterward.

**MODULES_LMNOTUASKED**

 A colon separated list of all loaded *modulefiles* that were not explicitly
 asked for load from the command-line.

 This environment variable is intended for **module** command internal
 use to distinguish the *modulefiles* that have been loaded automatically
 from modulefiles that have been asked by users.

**MODULES_LMPREREQ**

 A colon separated list of the **prereq** statements defined by all loaded
 *modulefiles*. Each element in this list starts by the name of the loaded
 *modulefile* declaring the pre-requirement followed by the name of all
 modulefiles it declares a prereq with. These loaded modulefiles and
 pre-required modulefile names are separated by the ampersand character. When
 a **prereq** statement is composed of multiple modulefiles, these modulefile
 names are separated by the pipe character.

 This environment variable is intended for **module** command internal
 use to get knowledge of the pre-requirement declared by the loaded
 *modulefiles* in order to keep environment consistent when a pre-required
 module is asked for unload afterward.

**MODULES_PAGER**

 Text viewer for use to paginate message output if error output stream is
 attached to a terminal. The value of this variable is composed of a pager
 command name or path eventually followed by command-line options.

 Paging command and options are defined for Modules in the following order of
 preference: **MODULES_PAGER** environment variable, then the default set in
 **modulecmd.tcl** script configuration. Which means **MODULES_PAGER**
 overrides default configuration.

 If **MODULES_PAGER** variable is set to an empty string or to the value
 *cat*, pager will not be launched.

**MODULES_RUNENV_<VAR>**

 Value to set to environment variable *<VAR>* for **modulecmd.tcl** run-time
 execution if *<VAR>* is referred in **MODULES_RUN_QUARANTINE**.

**MODULES_RUN_QUARANTINE**

 A space separated list of environment variable names that should be passed
 indirectly to **modulecmd.tcl** to protect its run-time environment from
 side-effect coming from their current definition.

 Each variable found in **MODULES_RUN_QUARANTINE** will have its value emptied
 or set to the value of the corresponding **MODULES_RUNENV_<VAR>** variable
 when defining **modulecmd.tcl** run-time environment.

 Original values of these environment variables set in quarantine are passed
 to **modulecmd.tcl** via **<VAR>_modquar** variables.

**MODULES_SILENT_SHELL_DEBUG**

 If set to **1**, disable any *xtrace* or *verbose* debugging property set on
 current shell session for the duration of either the module command or the
 module shell initialization script. Only applies to Bourne Shell (sh) and its
 derivatives.

**MODULES_SITECONFIG**

 Location of a site-specific configuration script to source into
 **modulecmd.tcl**. See also Modulecmd startup section.

**MODULES_TERM_BACKGROUND**

 Inform Modules of the terminal background color to determine if the color set
 for dark background or the color set for light background should be used to
 color output in case no specific color set is defined with the
 **MODULES_COLORS** variable. Accepted values are **dark** and **light**.

**MODULES_USE_COMPAT_VERSION**

 If set to **1** prior to Modules package initialization, enable
 Modules compatibility version (3.2 release branch) rather main version
 at initialization scripts running time. Modules package compatibility
 version should be installed along with main version for this environment
 variable to have any effect.

**_LMFILES_**

 A colon separated list of the full pathname for all loaded *modulefiles*.

**<VAR>_modquar**

 Value of environment variable *<VAR>* passed to **modulecmd.tcl** in order
 to restore *<VAR>* to this value once started.

**<VAR>_modshare**

 Reference counter variable for path-like variable *<VAR>*. A colon
 separated list containing pairs of elements. A pair is formed by a path
 element followed its usage counter which represents the number of times
 this path has been enabled in variable *<VAR>*. A colon separates the
 two parts of the pair.
