## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulnerability using GitHub's private reporting feature:

More details are available in
[GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

You can expect to hear back about security issues within five working days. If
your security issue is accepted, we will do our best to release a fix within
two weeks. If fixing the issue will take longer than this, we will discuss
timeline options with you.
