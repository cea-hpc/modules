Perl Support implements a Perl-IDE for Vim/gVim. It has been written to
considerably speed up writing code in a consistent style.  This is done by
inserting complete statements, comments, idioms, code snippets, templates, and
POD documentation.  Reading perldoc is integrated.  Syntax checking, running a
script, running perltidy,  running perlcritics, starting a debugger and a
profiler can be done with a keystroke.  There are many additional hints and
options which can improve speed and comfort when writing Perl. Please read the
documentation.
This plugin can be used with Vim version 7.x . Most features should work with
Vim version 6.x.

=======================================================================================
  INSTALLATION
=======================================================================================

The subdirectories in the zip archive  perl-support.zip  mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory $HOME/.vim/
for LINUX/UNIX ($VIM/vimfiles/ for Windows; find the value of $VIM with 
":echo $VIM" from inside Vim).

(0) Save the template files in '$HOME/.vim/perl-support/templates/Templates' if
    you have changed any of them.

(1) Copy the zip archive  perl-support.zip to $HOME/.vim and run

      unzip perl-support.zip

    If you have already an older version of perl-support and you have modified
    the template files you may want to save your templates first or copy the 
    files from the archive by hand.

(2) Loading of plugin files must be enabled. If not use
      :filetype plugin on
    This is the minimal content of the file '$HOME/.vimrc'. Create one if there
    is none. 

(3) Set at least some personal details into perl-support/templates/Templates 
    by overriding the defaults.  Here the minimal personalization (my settings
    as an example, of course):

      |AUTHOR|    = Dr. Fritz Mehner 
      |AUTHORREF| = fgm
      |EMAIL|     = mehner@fh-swf.de
      |COMPANY|   = FH Südwestfalen, Iserlohn
      |COPYRIGHT| = Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|

    Please read the documentation to fully understand the template system.

(4) Consider additional settings in the file '$HOME/.vimrc'.
    The files customization.vimrc and customization.gvimrc are replacements or 
    extensions for your .vimrc and .gvimrc ( _vimrc and _gvimrc under Windows).
    You may want to use parts of them. The files are documented. 

There are a lot of features and options which can be used and influenced:

  *  use of template files and tags
  *  using and managing personal code snippets
  *  Perl dictionary for keyword completion
  *  the Perl module list
  *  reading Perl documentation with integrated calls to perldoc
  *  removing the root menu
  *  using additional plugins

Restart gVim/Vim generate the help tags 

  :helptags ~/.vim/doc

and look at the perlsupport help with

  :help perlsupport

=======================================================================================
  ADDITIONAL TIPS
=======================================================================================

(1) You may want to use a central hidden directory for all your backup files (see also
    rc/customization.vimrc ):

    1.1 Add the following line to .vimrc (see also rc/customization.vimrc ):

      set backupdir  =$HOME/.vim.backupdir  
    
    1.2 Create  $HOME/.vim.backupdir  .

    1.3 Add the following line to your shell initialization file  ~/.profile :

      find $HOME/.vim.backupdir/  -name "*" -type f -mtime +60 -exec rm -f {} \;

    When you are logging in all files in the backup directory older then 60
    days (-mtime +60) will be removed (60 days is a suggestion, of course). 
    Be shure to backup in shorter terms !

(2) gVim. Toggle 'insert mode' <--> 'normal mode' with the right mouse button
    (see mapping in file customization.gvimrc).

(3) gVim. Use tear off menus.

(4) Try 'Focus under mouse' as window behavior (No mouse click when the mouse
    pointer is back from the menu entry).

(5) Use Emulate3Buttons "on" (X11) even for a 3-button mouse. Pressing left and
    right button simultaneously without moving your fingers is faster than 
    moving a finger to the middle button (which is often a wheel).
