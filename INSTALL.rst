Installing Modules on Unix
==========================

This document is an overview of building and installing Modules on a Unix
system.


Requirements
------------

Modules consists of one Tcl script so to run it from a user shell the only
requirement is to have a working version of ``tclsh`` (version 8.5 or later)
available on your system. ``tclsh`` is a part of Tcl
(http://www.tcl-lang.org/software/tcltk/).

To install Modules from a distribution tarball or a clone of the git
repository, a build step is there to tailor the :file:`modulecmd.tcl` and the
initialization scripts to the chosen installation configuration and create the
documentation files. This build step requires the tools to be found on your
system:

* bash
* make
* sed
* runtest

When also installing Modules Tcl extension library (enabled by default), these
additional tools are needed:

* grep
* gcc
* tcl-devel >= 8.5

When installing from a distribution tarball, documentation is pre-built and
scripts to configure Modules Tcl extension library build are already
generated. Thus no additional software is required. When installing from a
clone of the git repository or from a git archive export, documentation and
scripts to prepare for compilation have to be built and the following tools
are required:

* autoconf
* automake
* autopoint
* m4
* python
* sphinx >= 1.0
* gzip

Get Modules
-----------

Modules can usually be installed with the package manager of your Unix system.
It it is available by default `on most Linux distributions, on OS X and
FreeBSD <https://repology.org/project/environment-modules/versions>`_ either
under the name of ``modules`` or ``environment-modules``.

If you want to install Modules from sources, tarballs from all Modules'
releases can be retrieved from one of the following link:

* https://github.com/cea-hpc/modules/releases/
* https://sourceforge.net/projects/modules/files/Modules/

For instance to download then unpack the last release of Modules:

.. parsed-literal::

    :ps:`$` curl -LJO |gh_tgz_dl_url|
    :ps:`$` tar xfz modules-\ |version|\ .tar.gz

Installation instructions
-------------------------

The simplest way to build and install Modules is:

.. parsed-literal::

    :ps:`$` ./configure
    :ps:`$` make
    :ps:`$` make install

Some explanation, step by step:

1. ``cd`` to the directory containing the package's source code. Your system
   must have the above requirements installed to properly build scripts, and
   documentation if build occurs from a clone of the git repository.

2. Type ``./configure`` to adapt the installation for your system. At this
   step you can choose the installation paths and the features you want to
   enable in the initialization scripts (see `Build and installation options`_
   section below for a complete overview of the available options)

3. Type ``make`` to adapt scripts to the configuration, build Tcl extension
   library if enabled and build documentation if working from git repository.

4. Optionally, type ``make test`` to run the test suite.

5. Type ``make install`` to install modulecmd.tcl, initialization scripts and
   documentation.

6. Optionally, type ``make testinstall`` to run the installation test suite.

7. You can remove the built files from the source code directory by typing
   ``make clean``. To also remove the files that ``configure`` created, type
   ``make distclean``.

A default installation process like described above will install Modules
under ``/usr/local/Modules``. You can change this with the :instopt:`--prefix`
option. By default, ``/usr/local/Modules/modulefiles`` will be setup as
the default directory containing modulefiles. :instopt:`--modulefilesdir`
option enables to change this directory location. For example:

.. parsed-literal::

    :ps:`$` ./configure --prefix=/usr/share/Modules \\
                  --modulefilesdir=/etc/modulefiles

See `Build and installation options`_ section to discover all ``./configure``
option available.

.. note:: GNU Make is excepted to be used for this build and installation
   process. On non-Linux systems, the ``gmake`` should be called instead of
   ``make``.


Configuration
-------------

Once installed you should review and adapt the configuration to make it fit
your needs. The following steps are provided for example. They are not
necessarily mandatory as it depends of the kind of setup you want to achieve.

1. Enable Modules initialization at shell startup. An easy way to get module
   function defined and its associated configuration setup at shell startup
   is to make the initialization scripts part of the system-wide environment
   setup in ``/etc/profile.d``. To do so, make a link in this directory to the
   profile scripts that can be found in your Modules installation init
   directory:

   .. parsed-literal::

       :ps:`$` ln -s PREFIX/init/profile.sh /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
       :ps:`$` ln -s PREFIX/init/profile.csh /etc/profile.d/modules.csh

   These profile scripts will automatically adapt to the kind of ``sh`` or
   ``csh`` shell you are running.

   Another approach may be to get the Modules initialization script sourced
   from the shell configuration startup file. For instance following line
   could be added to the end of the ``~/.bashrc`` file if running Bash shell::

       source PREFIX/init/bash

   Beware that shells have multiple ways to initialize depending if they are
   a login shell or not and if they are launched in interactive mode or not.

2. Define module paths to enable by default. Edit :file:`initrc` configuration
   file in the directory designated by the :instopt:`--etcdir` option or edit
   :file:`modulespath` in the same directory.

   If you use :file:`modulespath` configuration file, add one line mentioning
   each modulefile directory::

       /path/to/regular/modulefiles
       /path/to/other/modulefiles

   If you use :file:`initrc` configuration file, add one line mentioning each
   modulefile directory prefixed by the :subcmd:`module use<use>` command:

   .. code-block:: tcl

       module use /path/to/regular/modulefiles
       module use /path/to/other/modulefiles

   In case both configuration files :file:`initrc` and :file:`modulespath` are
   present, Modules initialization process will first evaluate
   :file:`modulespath` then :file:`initrc`.

   By default, the modulepaths specified on the :instopt:`--with-modulepath`
   installation option are automatically defined for use in :file:`initrc` (or
   in :file:`modulespath` if the :instopt:`--enable-modulespath` installation
   option has been set).

   .. note:: If you have set :instopt:`--with-initconf-in` to ``initdir`` to
      install the Modules initialization configurations in the configuration
      directory designated by the :instopt:`--initdir` option, the configuration
      files :file:`initrc` and :file:`modulespath` are respectively named
      ``modulerc`` and ``.modulespath``.

3. Define modulefiles to load by default. Edit :file:`initrc` configuration
   file. Modulefiles to load cannot be specified in :file:`modulespath` file.
   Add there all the modulefiles you want to load by default at Modules
   initialization time.

   Add one line mentioning each modulefile to load prefixed by the
   :subcmd:`module load<load>` command:

   .. code-block:: tcl

       module load foo
       module load bar

   By default, the modules specified on the :instopt:`--with-loadedmodules`
   installation option are automatically defined for load in :file:`initrc`.

   Alternatively, if users have :ref:`module collections<collections>` saved
   in their :envvar:`HOME` directory, you may prefer restoring their default
   collection when Modules initializes rather loading the default module list:

   .. code-block:: tcl

       if {[is-saved default]} {
           module restore
       } else {
           module load foo
           module load bar
       }

   In fact you can add to the :file:`initrc` configuration file any kind of
   supported module command, like :subcmd:`module config<config>` commands to
   tune :command:`module`'s default behaviors. This configuration way is
   recommended over directly modifying the shell initialization scripts.

See the `Configuration options`_ section to discover all Modules
:subcmd:`config` options available, their default value and the installation
options linked to them.

If you go through the above steps you should have a valid setup tuned to your
needs. After that you still have to write modulefiles to get something to
load and unload in your newly configured Modules setup. In case you want to
achieve a specific setup, some additional steps may be required:

4. In case the configuration you expect cannot be achieved through the
   :file:`initrc` configuration file, you may review and tune the
   initialization scripts. These files are located in the directory designated
   by the :instopt:`--initdir` option. Beware that these scripts could be
   overwritten when upgrading to a newer version of Modules, so configuration
   should be done through the :file:`initrc` file as far as possible.

5. If you want to alter the way the :file:`modulecmd.tcl` script operates, the
   :file:`siteconfig.tcl` script may be used. This Tcl file is located in the
   directory designated by the :instopt:`--etcdir` option. Every time the
   :command:`module` command is called, it executes the :file:`modulecmd.tcl`
   script which in turns sources the :file:`siteconfig.tcl` script during its
   startup phase. The site-specific configuration script could override
   default configuration values and more largely could supersede all
   procedures defined in :file:`modulecmd.tcl` to obtain specific behaviors.

6. Prior running the module sub-command specified as argument, the
   :file:`modulecmd.tcl` script evaluates the global run-command files. These
   files are either the :file:`rc` file in the directory designated by the
   :instopt:`--etcdir` option, the file(s) designated in the
   :envvar:`MODULERCFILE` environment variable or the user-specific RC file
   located in :file:`$HOME/.modulerc`. The RC files are modulefiles (limited
   to a subset of the :ref:`modulefile Tcl
   commands<Modules specific Tcl commands>`) that could define global module
   aliases, virtual modules or module properties such as tags, forbidding
   rules, etc.

   .. note:: Run-command files are intended to set parameters for
      modulefiles, not to configure the :command:`module` command itself.

To learn more about siteconfig and run-command files, see the
:ref:`Modulecmd startup` section in :ref:`module(1)` reference manual. You may
also look at the available :ref:`setup recipes<cookbook>` to get concrete
deployment examples of these files.

    .. versionchanged:: 5.3
       Element ``variantifspec`` added and set by default

    .. versionchanged:: 5.3.1
       Element ``indesym`` added

.. instopt:: --with-bashcompletiondir=DIR

 Directory for Bash completion scripts. When this option is not set Bash
 completion script for Modules is installed in the initialization script
 directory and is sourced from Modules Bash initialization script. (default=)

 .. only:: html

    .. versionadded:: 5.1

.. instopt:: --with-bin-search-path=PATHLIST

 List of paths to look at when searching the location of tools required to
 build and configure Modules (default=\ ``/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/bin``)

 .. only:: html

    .. versionadded:: 4.2

.. instopt:: --with-dark-background-colors=SGRLIST

 Default color set to apply if terminal background color is defined to
 ``dark``. SGRLIST follows the same syntax than used in ``LS_COLORS``. Each
 element in SGRLIST is an output item associated to a Select Graphic Rendition
 (SGR) code. Elements in SGRLIST are separated by ``:``. Output items are
 designated by keys.

 Items able to be colorized are: highlighted element (``hi``), debug
 information (``db``), trace information (``tr``) tag separator (``se``);
 Error (``er``), warning (``wa``), module error (``me``) and info (``in``)
 message prefixes; Modulepath (``mp``), directory (``di``), module alias
 (``al``), module variant (``va``), module symbolic version (``sy``) and
 module ``default`` version (``de``).

 :ref:`Module tags` can also be colorized. The key to set in the color palette
 to get a graphical rendering of a tag is the tag name or the tag abbreviation
 if one is defined for tag. The SGR code applied to a tag name is ignored if
 an abbreviation is set for this tag thus the SGR code should be defined for
 this abbreviation to get a graphical rendering. Each basic tag has by default
 a key set in the color palette, based on its abbreviated string: auto-loaded
 (``aL``), forbidden (``F``), hidden and hidden-loaded (``H``), loaded
 (``L``), nearly-forbidden (``nF``), sticky (``S``), super-sticky (``sS``) and
 keep-loaded (``kL``).
